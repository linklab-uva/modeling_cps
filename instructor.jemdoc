The course staff is here to help you.
Please donâ€™t wait until too late to take advantage of the available help or ask for help.
For nearly everyone, this course will involve learning new ways of thinking that are dramatically different from those to which you are accustomed.
It is natural to miss things, and then become lost since new ideas build on previous ones.
Come to office hours early to get help before you find yourself frustrated and confused.
