OAS is a fully open-source library of Voyageâ€™s safety processes and testing procedures, designed to supplement existing safety programs at self-driving car startups across the world. **We aim to make OAS a standard in the industry, driving us all to safer testing and operation of autonomous vehicles.** When it comes to safety, we believe open is better, and as such we welcome contributions to make OAS better. The purpose of this project is not to benefit Voyage, but to elevate the field to a higher standard of safety.

Contributions are welcome!
