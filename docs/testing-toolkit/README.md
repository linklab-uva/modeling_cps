The OAS Testing Toolkit is a Sketch library and asset collection designed to quickly and effectively communicate testing scenarios. The Testing Toolkit is best used with Sketch Libraries but it can also be used in word documents, presentations or any software with graphic importing capabilities.

All testing scenarios seen in the current version of the OAS use the Testing Toolkit and we welcome contributions to improve the kit for the future.
