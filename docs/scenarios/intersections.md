There are many combinations of intersection scenarios, and the expectation is that all combinations will be detailed as this project continues.

:::tip Action IDs
**01**: Ego has right of way <br>
**02**: Actor has right of way <br>
**03**: Ego has right of way, but actor takes it <br>
**04**: Ego has right of way, but actor is blocking right of way

| B    | ![I-07-B](./images/I-07-B.png) | **Scenario** <br> Secondary vehicle does not stop and starts to proceed through intersection. <br><br> **Expected Result** <br> Ego stops to yield to misbehaving secondary vehicle. |
| C    | ![I-07-C](./images/I-07-C.png) | **Scenario** <br> Secondary vehicle continues through intersection. <br><br> **Expected Result** <br> Ego remains stopped until secondary vehicle is out of intersection and proceeds. |

| :--: | --- | --- |
| A    | ![I-03-A](./images/I-03-A.png) | **Scenario** <br> Ego approaches intersection. Secondary vehicle approaches from North and enters the intersection. <br><br> **Expected Result** <br> Ego comes to a stop in front of the stopline. |
| B    | ![I-03-B](./images/I-03-B.png) | **Scenario** <br> Secondary vehicle continues through the intersection. <br><br> **Expected Result** <br> Ego remains stopped. |
